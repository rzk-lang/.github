## Rzk proof assistant, satellite tools, and formalisations

This organisation collects some repositories related to [rzk](https://github.com/rzk-lang/rzk), an experimental proof assistant for synthetic ∞-categories:

- [rzk-lang/rzk](https://github.com/rzk-lang/rzk) — the Rzk proof assistant

Below we list other repositories in this organisation with brief descriptions.

## Tooling around the proof assistant

- [rzk-lang/vscode-rzk](https://github.com/rzk-lang/vscode-rzk) — VS Code extension for `rzk` (recommended)
- [rzk-lang/mkdocs-plugin-rzk](https://github.com/rzk-lang/mkdocs-plugin-rzk) — MkDocs plugin for `rzk` (diagram rendering, definition anchors, etc.)
- [rzk-lang/rzk-action](https://github.com/rzk-lang/rzk-action) — GitHub Action for running `rzk` to check formalisations
- [rzk-lang/pygments-rzk](https://github.com/rzk-lang/pygments-rzk) — syntax highlighter for Pygments (used by MkDocs and `minted` package in LaTeX)
- 🚧 [rzk-lang/rzk.sty](https://github.com/rzk-lang/rzk.sty) — LaTeX package for `rzk` (will appear soon)

## Formalisation projects

- [rzk-lang/sHoTT](https://github.com/rzk-lang/sHoTT) — an active formalisation project for simplicial HoTT
- [rzk-lang/hottbook](https://github.com/rzk-lang/hottbook) — the [HoTT Book](https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/) formalisations in `rzk` (early stages)
- Known external formalizations:
    - [emilyriehl/yoneda](https://github.com/emilyriehl/yoneda) — the ∞-categorical Yoneda lemma (and its variations), and comparison with 1-categorical versions in other provers
- Templates:
    - [rzk-lang/rzk-project-template](https://github.com/rzk-lang/rzk-project-template) — template repository for `rzk` formalisations

## Extra materials

### Demos and tutorials

- <https://fizruk.github.io/itp-school-2023-demo/> — demo/tutorial for the [«Interactions of Proof Assistants and Mathematics» school](https://itp-school-2023.github.io)
  in Regensburg, September 18–29, 2023, containing introduction to the syntax of Rzk and basics of theorem proving in Rzk, as well as a few exercises.
- <https://fizruk.github.io/bmstu-rzk-demo-2023/> — demo/tutorial the HoTT seminar at Bauman Moscow State Technical University, Nov 20–21, 2023;
  contains a partial introduction to homotopy type theory (following the [HoTT Book](https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/)) and simplicial type theory in Rzk.
  Perhaps, the most approachable tutorial for newcomers unfamiliar with both dependent types and homotopy type theory.
